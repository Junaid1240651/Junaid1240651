Whiteboard Canvas- Here, all team members can draw, sketch, and brainstorm together in real-time. Whether it's illustrating ideas, mapping out strategies, or simply doodling, everyone's contributions appear instantly on each other's screens.

But that's not all - our document editor takes collaboration to the next level. With the ability for all users to write, edit, and format text simultaneously, creating documents has never been more efficient. Whether it's drafting reports, crafting proposals, or outlining strategies, every heading, paragraph, and edit is reflected instantly across all team members' screens.

When one user clicks on "Save File Changes," the updates are automatically saved for all users, no need for others to manually save.
